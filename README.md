# Photo-Submission Web Application
This is a PHP based online application that allows users to upload photos and moderators to screen the photos (approve or reject). It has two interfaces for the public and moderators. It incorporates search and sort functionalities for the moderator as well as public visitors. The website is created by me entirely from scratch including all the UI components.

This site is currently being used by Mount Douglas Secondary School to gather photos for the Yearbook Editors. It is visited by thousands of people each year. 

Please visit the link below for an interactive project showcase that demonstrates the functionality of this website.
